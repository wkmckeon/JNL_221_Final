		<h1>As Advanced Analytics Grow, Strikeouts Remain Prominent</h1>

		<p>As the analytical age of baseball takes over, the old generation of statistics have become “outdated" to many. Stats such as batting average, runs batted in (RBI), and earned run average (ERA) have seemingly gone extinct since the introduction of new-wave statistics. A player’s skill is now determined by their wins above replacement (WAR) total, weighted runs created plus (WRC+), and plenty more.  </p>
		<p>And yet despite these analytic developments, one of the most basic stats remains relevant: strikeouts. The “K,” as it is commonly referred to, has managed to beat the odds and remain an important fixture in the baseball statistics world. How? Through its everlasting impact that can’t be replaced or replicated, an increase in them over the years, and the significance they continue to play in the game.</p>

		<h2>The strikeout's inability to be outdated</h2>

		<p>As new ways to measure a player’s success have arrived on the baseball scene, others have suffered the consequences. WRC+ has singlehandedly eliminated the RBI from holding any weight. A pitcher’s raw win total is useless due to the introduction of WAR. The strikeout, meanwhile, has prevailed as an irreplaceable piece of baseball data.</p>
		<p>The action of a strikeout is quite simple. Either the ball passes through the strike zone and the batter doesn't attempt to swing, or the batter takes a whack at it and fails to make contact. Add in the occasional foul-tip where the batter makes an ounce of contact and the ball lands directly in the catcher’s mitt, and you’ve got all the possible strikeout outcomes.</p>
		<p>There’s nothing more to be examined. Yes, <i>why</i> the batter struck out can be analyzed - spin rate, torque rate of the batter, etc. - but at the end of the day, the at-bat goes down as a K.</p>
		<p>The advanced analytics of today may suggest a player is outperforming their basic stats of batting average and runs batted in, but a high strikeout rate remains problematic.</p>
		<p>Suppose a player is among the league leaders in weighted on-base average (wOBA) and on-base plus slugging plus (OPS+). In this hypothetical, let’s also say the batter has struck out over 200 times.</p>
		<p>The next-gen statistics suggest the player is having a great season. In reality, the player is consistently failing to give his teammates a chance on the base path. That outweighs a strong OPS+.</p>

		<h3>Their consistent increase</h3>

		<p>While baseball has witnessed an intense power increase over the years - Seattle’s single-season homerun record (264) set in 1997 has been broken five times since 2018 - a higher strikeout rate has come with it.  </p>
		<p>The reason behind the power increase is thanks to the MLB’s constant adjustment of baseballs. The 2019 season saw a record 6,776 home runs mashed, thanks to a “juiced” ball implemented by the league. And yet while the players were gifted with the most batter-friendly ball ever, they continued to strike out at the highest rate in Major League Baseball history. </p>

</script>
		<p>Following the conclusion of the 2021 season, the MLB shared they had used two different balls throughout the season. Some were “juiced” and others “dead.” The different types of balls once again didn’t make a difference though. While only a .4% increase from 2019 to 2021, Ks have remained a focal point of the sport.</p>

		<h4>Their in-game significance</h4>
		<p>Bases loaded. Nobody out. Game 7 of the World Series. How does the pitcher get out of the jam? Strikeouts.</p>
		<p>Keeping the ball out of play is the best thing a pitcher can do in this situation. A pop-out and 6-4-3 double play would get the job done but is a heck of a lot more stressful than sending the batter back to the dugout in frustration.</p>
		<p>Time and time again there are moments in baseball where the batter’s sole job is to not strikeout. Situational hitting, as it’s called, is one of the most underrated skills a player can possess. Being able to advance the runner from second to third with a soft grounder down the first base line or driving in the runner from third with a deep fly ball to center can be the difference between a win and a loss.</p>
		<p>Thomas Hall, a freelance baseball analyst based in Virginia, spoke on the importance of having a batter that can put the ball in play, or at least get on base via a walk. He described the players who swing for the fences rather than playing small ball as a “liability” at the plate.</p>
		<p>Hall’s thoughts on being conservative at the plate are supported by statistics as well.</p>

</script>
		<p>It’s not by coincidence that the two top teams in Major League Baseball were both excellent at not striking out. They made the most of their opportunities while at the plate all season and capitalized when given the chance.</p>
		<p>It would be extremely beneficial for every player to take Hall’s advice and focus on reaching base safely, or if unable, just making contact. No matter how successful a batter is according to advanced analytics, strikeouts will continue to nag them until the end of time.</p>
